# SYMBINT v1

## Scope of the program

This program is part of a thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Mathematics at the University of Oviedo. The idea was to implement an algorithm that could compute an integral of a given rational function, i.e. that could find an antiderivative for a given quotient of polynomials $p$ and $q$ in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$.
